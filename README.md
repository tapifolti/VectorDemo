# VectorDemo - C++  lib to be called from Java

1. Compile, build in Visual Studio for Windows
1. Generate JNI wrapper with SWIG
	1. Use SWIG: http://www.swig.org/Doc3.0/SWIGDocumentation.html 
		1. Find Swig 3.0+ download on Internet
		1. Unzip, it contains swig.exe and example projects
		1. Goto the C++ project folder
		1. Add 
			1. JAVA_INCLUDE : Set this to the directory containing jni.h -- $(JAVA_HOME)\include
			1. JAVA_BIN : Set this to the bin directory containing javac.exe -- $(JAVA_HOME)\bin
			1. Need to add include folder to the project: $(JAVA_HOME)\include;$(JAVA_HOME)\include\win32
			1. For Win32 may need to add: ..\include\win32\jni_md.h as include to the generated cpp file
			1. Run SWIG like: `".\swigwin-3.0.12\swig.exe" -java -package <target_java_package> -c++ -o WebTest_wrap.cpp WebTest.i`
			1. Where *.i file is created manually 
			1. Build C++ project after added the generated CPP: WebTest_wrap.cpp
			1. Built C++ project should match to the target OS (32/64 bit)
			1. Pick *.dll file and copy to Java projectâ€™s subfolder, it should be loaded via Java code
			1. Pick the generated Java files and add to the Java project, use them to easily call C++ methods
1. Build with Makefile for Linux
	1. `docker run --rm -v /L/Zsuzsa/PeterProject/WebDemo/WebTest:/tmpdev -w /tmpdev uppoints/docker-java-gcc make`
